## Infrastructure Architecture
![](docs/Back_office_architecture.png?raw=true)


## Assumptions
I assumed that the metric I will be using to scale up the number of workers is the CPUUtilization and also I assumed the threshold as the number of job in queues.

1. For cost I used t2.micro instance type and also if there are no pending job in the queue, the instance is scaled down to zero

2. For reusability I have three environment which for further use case will contain different resources based onthe environment been used.

3. For security, I am using state locking and also each environment is been isolated from the other.
